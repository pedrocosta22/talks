Description
-----------

This talk is about the growing field of Biofabrication, which uses highly automated technologies such as 3D printing to generate human tissue/organ substitutes. Biofabrication technologies can nowadays also be used to create organs-on-chips, which act as miniature living analogues of human tissues and organs. In this way, by submitting these miniature analogues to specific conditions, it is possible to predict what would be the reaction/behavior of real tissues and organs in a real situation. One clear benefit of biofabricated organs-on-chips in the future, would be the improvement of new drug and treatment discovery with consequent reduction of animal testing. Due to the high degree of automation employed in biofabrication, programming has an immensely important role in this field. It can be applied not only during the physical 3D printing of devices/tissue substitutes, but as well during the upstream 3D digital design and downstream analysis of the behavior of tissue/organ analogues.

Speaker Bio
-----------

Pedro Costa is a researcher, inventor and educator. He can be described as a biologist by training and engineer/maker by heart, given his undergraduate studies in applied biology followed by a PhD in biomedical engineering where he specialized in the application/combination of highly automated tools such as additive manufacturing (bioprinting) and bioreactor technologies in the field of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. For more than a decade, he has been working in both academic and industrial environments in places such as Portugal (University of Minho), Belgium (Materialise NV), Australia (Queensland University of Technology), Germany (Technical University of Munich) and more recently in the Netherlands (UMC Utrecht/Utrecht University) where he also coordinated a Biofabrication MSc programme and managed a biofabrication facility. Pedro’s interests further include generation/management of intellectual property and entrepreneurship. Pedro has also received several awards for his work, among them the 2014 ESB Translational Award and the 2016 ISBF Young Investigator Award (2nd place).
